# 1.6.0-alpha1 (2020-09-20)

What's new

- New: Glass now supports Prat's History module! As long as it's enabled, Glass now restores your chat message history.

Bug fixes

- Fixed: There was an issue where messages that were received before Glass initialized were lost (e.g. Guild Message of the Day). This has now been fixed.
