## Why?

I wanted to have a chat UI that didn't look like it was designed in 2004.

I tried several addons that customize the chat interface but was left
unsatisfied. So I decided to make one myself.

The goal of Glass is to be unobtrusive. Messages only appear when they come in
and fades out after a few seconds. Chat tabs are hidden until the player hovers
over the chat UI. There is no always-visible background. Glass is invisible
until the player needs it.

## Install

Glass is available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/glass)

You may also download the latest release on [GitHub](https://github.com/mixxorz/Glass/releases)

## Commands

* `/glass` - open the settings window
* `/glass lock` - unlock the chat frame

## Customization

Not everyone likes the same look. Glass tries to accommodate your own
preferences by giving you options to change the:

* Chat frame width, height, and location
* Font and font size
* Message fade out delay
* Background opacity

Moreover, unlike the default chat UI, these settings may be shared between
characters.

## Addon compatibility

* ElvUI
  * Yes, but disable the Chat module
* Prat 3.0
  * Yes, but disable the EditBox module
  * Prat timestamps are supported. If you want to disable timestamps, you'll
      need to set the Timestamps module on Prat to "Don't load".
